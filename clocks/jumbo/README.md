# "Jumbo" ProDOS Clock Driver

This is an amalgamation of the other clock driver installers. Each one is tried in turn, until one successfully installs a clock driver.

The drivers are (in order):

* No-Slot Clock
* ROMX
* FujiNet
* Cricket!
* DClock

The installer is silent - no output is shown on either failure or success.
